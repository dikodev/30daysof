            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="welcome">Welcome!<a class="hash-link" href="#welcome" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Hello and welcome to the launch of the #30DaysOf learning hub. üëãüèΩ</p><p>This is a collaborative effort within Developer Relations to collect and share various resources that support self-study and structured learning for beginners and experienced devs alike. Technology changes fast! The only way to adapt, and thrive, is to learn continuously - and apply learnings to practical problems.</p><p>So, what does that learning journey look like? Think of it as four stages:</p><ul><li><strong>Welcome</strong> - the onboarding phase where you get setup for the journey. </li><li><strong>Guide</strong> - the resource exploration phase, where you pick the path to travel.</li><li><strong>Connect</strong> - the community phase where you interact with others on the same journey.</li><li><strong>Share</strong> - the pay-it-forward phase where you share your learnings to help the next traveller.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Placeholder banner with red flowers" src="/30daysof/assets/images/empty-21460021e4358d11e7c45383dc187d62.png" width="1600" height="672" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-the-site">About The Site<a class="hash-link" href="#about-the-site" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Let's take a quick tour of this site and the various features it offers:</p><ul><li><a href="/30daysof/">Landing Page</a> - explore the learning options available.</li><li><a href="/30daysof/blog">Blog</a> - subscribe to the <a href="/30daysof/blog/rss.xml">feed</a> for announcements &amp; updates</li><li><a href="/30daysof/calendar">Calendar</a> - discover upcoming events, revisit archived ones</li><li><a href="/30daysof/docs/category/roadmaps">Roadmaps</a> - discover and complete #30Day journeys</li><li><a href="/30daysof/docs/category/curricula">Curricula</a> - explore open-source multi-week courses with lesson plans</li><li><a href="/30daysof/docs/category/challenges">Challenges</a> - join challenges and compete with your peers</li><li><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/30daysof/discussions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discussions</a> - ask questions, interact with peers, show-and-tell!</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="your-first-actions">Your First Actions<a class="hash-link" href="#your-first-actions" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Where should you start? </p><ol><li><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/30daysof/discussions/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Take a minute to introduce yourself</a> - What are you looking to learn? What are <em>you</em> an expert in? Which region are you joining us from?</li><li><a href="/30daysof/calendar">Check the calendar</a> - look for upcoming or in-progress learning journeys (e.g., #30Days) and join in! Work at your own pace, or look for events and discussions where you can interact with other learners.</li><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/04/education/edlife/learning-how-to-learn-barbara-oakley.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cultivate learning habits</a> - Use techniques that help you learn to learn better. Take breaks, switch between focused and relaxed modes, practice what you learn, and understand that each person learns differently.</li></ol><p>Most importantly, <strong>set a goal and keep going towards it one learning step at a time</strong> - connect with others to get help or feel inspired. Then pay it forward by sharing blog posts and showcasing your apps, so others can learn from <em>you</em>.</p><p>We can't wait to see what you learn - next!</p>]]></content:encoded>
