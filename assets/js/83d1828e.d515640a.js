(6 initiatives)\\n * How can I _participate_? (3 actions)\\n * How can I _skill up_ (30 days)\\n * Who is behind this? (Team Contributors)\\n * How can _you_ contribute? (Custom Issues)\\n * **Exercise**: Take the [Cloud Skills Challenge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/challenges?id=b950cd7a-d456-46ab-81ba-3bd1ad86dc1c&WT.mc_id=javascript-74010-ninarasi)!\\n * **Resources**: [#30DaysOfServerless Collection](https://aka.ms/30DaysOfServerless/collection).\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## Welcome! \\n\\nHello and welcome to the launch of the #30DaysOf learning hub. \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffd\\n\\nThis is a collaborative effort within Developer Relations to collect and share various resources that support self-study and structured learning for beginners and experienced devs alike. Technology changes fast! The only way to adapt, and thrive, is to learn continuously - and apply learnings to practical problems.\\n\\nSo, what does that learning journey look like? Think of it as four stages:\\n * **Welcome** - the onboarding phase where you get setup for the journey. \\n * **Guide** - the resource exploration phase, where you pick the path to travel.\\n * **Connect** - the community phase where you interact with others on the same journey.\\n * **Share** - the pay-it-forward phase where you share your learnings to help the next traveller.\\n\\n![Placeholder banner with red flowers](./../../static/img/banners/empty.png)\\n\\n## About The Site\\n\\nLet\'s take a quick tour of this site and the various features it offers:\\n\\n * [Landing Page](/) - explore the learning options available.\\n * [Blog](/blog) - subscribe to the [feed](/blog/rss.xml) for announcements & updates\\n * [Calendar](/calendar) - discover upcoming events, revisit archived ones\\n * [Roadmaps](/docs/category/roadmaps) - discover and complete #30Day journeys\\n * [Curricula](/docs/category/curricula) - explore open-source multi-week courses with lesson plans\\n * [Challenges](/docs/category/challenges) - join challenges and compete with your peers\\n * [Discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/30daysof/discussions) - ask questions, interact with peers, show-and-tell!\\n\\n\\n## Your First Actions\\n\\nWhere should you start? \\n\\n1. [Take a minute to introduce yourself](https://github.com/microsoft/30daysof/discussions/3) - What are you looking to learn? What are *you* an expert in? Which region are you joining us from?\\n2. [Check the calendar](/calendar) - look for upcoming or in-progress learning journeys (e.g., #30Days) and join in! Work at your own pace, or look for events and discussions where you can interact with other learners.\\n3. [Cultivate learning habits](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/04/education/edlife/learning-how-to-learn-barbara-oakley.html) - Use techniques that help you learn to learn better. Take breaks, switch between focused and relaxed modes, practice what you learn, and understand that each person learns differently.\\n\\nMost importantly, **set a goal and keep going towards it one learning step at a time** - connect with others to get help or feel inspired. Then pay it forward by sharing blog posts and showcasing your apps, so others can learn from _you_.\\n\\nWe can\'t wait to see what you learn - next!"}]}')}}]);
